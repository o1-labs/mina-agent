# mina-agent

A structural harness for working on the Mina monorepo with Claude Code. It
makes correct behaviour a property of the tools rather than of prose: builds,
type-checks, and tests go through one MCP server that runs dune in the right
switch; the dependency graph is derived from the dune files, never written by
hand; build configuration and the Rust proof-systems boundary cannot be
edited; the raw toolchain (dune, opam, nix, cargo, make, pip, ocaml*) and the
opam-switch scripts cannot be run. Headless phases
and interactive sessions both start from that same set of walls and facts,
and only when invoked through `mina-agent`: nothing is written into the
repo's Claude settings, so plain `claude` sessions are unaffected.

    uv tool install ./harness            # --editable while developing the harness itself
    mina-agent admin setup && mina-agent admin init && mina-agent doctor
    mina-agent --help

The tool lives in uv's tool directory, not in the checkout, so it survives
checking out branches that predate `harness/`. Reinstall after changing the
harness source.

Every command answers `--help`. Listings of tools, tests, and phases are
derived, not documented: `mina-agent show tools|tests|phases`.

The one thing `--help` cannot tell you: the edit deny rules cover Claude's
file tools and the shell commands Claude Code recognises, not a script the
model writes that opens a file itself. Closing that needs the sandbox, which
this harness does not configure.

Known limitation: the harness serializes the dune calls it makes, but not
a `dune build -w` you run yourself; on the pinned dune (3.3.1) two dune
processes on one `_build` can corrupt each other's temporaries, and the
native fix (`dune rpc build` into the watcher) is experimental there. Stop
the watcher while the agent builds, until the dune pin moves.

Development: `uv run pytest` runs the pure tests under `tests/` (no
toolchain needed); `uv run pyright` type-checks the package. Shared record
types live in `mina_agent/model.py`; modules pass those, and `to_json()`
serializes at the MCP and log edges.

Secrets: fix-bug reads GitHub issues with `gh`, authenticated however this
machine already is (`gh auth login`); where that is not possible, put
`GH_TOKEN` in `harness/.envrc` (gitignored, see `.envrc.example`) and every
session sources it. A phase declares tools it needs with `needs:` and
variables with `env:` in its front matter and refuses to start without
them. Commits made in any harness session are the user's own: no
Co-Authored-By or Generated-with lines.

Reporting a harness bug: in any interactive session, say what went wrong
and the harness-bug-report skill drafts an issue for o1-labs/mina-agent,
bundles the evidence (environment, doctor, recent run logs, lint log,
profiling session) into a zip under the temp dir, and files it with `gh`
once you agree on the text. Without `gh` it saves the draft and tells you
where both files are. GitHub cannot take the zip through the API; drag it
onto the issue in the browser.

Verifying a PR's performance claims: `mina-agent run verify-perf --pr <number>`
opens a TUI session (this phase is interactive by default; `--headless` runs
it unattended) that reads the PR, locates the workload it says it measured (and stops if it
does not say), then measures base and head with no instrumentation:
/usr/bin/time for wall clock and peak RSS, the runtime's GC counters for
bytes allocated, and samply for the share of samples under a named
function. It reports whether the claimed numbers roughly recover.

Writing code: `mina-agent develop` is discuss's opposite. Edits are accepted
without asking, tests may be run, and the shell is an allowlist enforced by
a hook (git, gh, `mina-agent lint/list/status/doctor`, read-only utilities;
the list is `[develop]` in `manifest.toml`, grow it as needed). The raw
toolchain and build configuration stay walled; building and testing go
through the harness tools.

Benchmarking: in a develop (or discuss) session the `benchmarking` skill
picks the instrument for the question: `perf_measure` on the working tree
or `perf_compare` between commits for samply sample shares, exact
allocation, peak RSS and wall clock, or a landmarks profiling session for
per-function attribution. Results are recorded under `state/perf/`.

`--continue` on discuss and develop resumes that mode's last session (the
harness records its own sessions from the SessionStart hook, so a plain
`claude` conversation in the same directory is never picked by mistake).
